/**  Recursion
 * 1.what is the least amount of work I can do
 * 2.when would the process be completed
 * 3.break a problem into smaller problem, solving each samller problem gets me closer to the solution
 *
 * base case:
 *             if(xxx===){
 *               return someResult
 *                      }
 *           //stop recursing,
 *           //the returned result will proprogate down to the next call in call stack till the very first call
 *
 * return recursion(someValue+1 )  //recursive call , get closer to my final answer
